# Image_Classification

My first image classification project using keras package, https://keras.io/getting_started/.

Data was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia.

Results:

  I trained the model using augmented dataset and original dataset, and it is shown that the model provides better predictions using the original dataset.
